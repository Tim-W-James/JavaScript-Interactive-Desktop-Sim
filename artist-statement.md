# Artist Statement

My piece represents both literal and metaphorical meanings from the prompt “view through a window”.  It displays a mock computer desktop, with an application window while running on the windows 7 operating system, both modern, technological uses for the term 'window'.  However, the 'view' in the application window subverts the expectation of an actual application or program.  Instead, the viewer can see directly into the electronic hardware of the computer itself, revealing the complex circuitry and inner workings of the machine.

The viewer can interact with the piece by dragging the window across the screen, again reinforcing the familiar appearance and usability of a computer desktop.  Yet the viewer can continue peering into different parts of the circuit as the window moves, acting as a peephole into the sophisticated technology.

My piece reflects an encapsulation in modern technology, where the intricate mechanics are hidden from users, in order to preserve an elegant and simple appearance.  The work plays on the familiar parts of technology, while revealing its fundamental processes in an unexpected way.
